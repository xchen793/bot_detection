# A/B testing 
In Ze's (Name) research project, we need to decide to use either "english" score or "universal" score to determine whether a Twitter account is a bot or not. (LINK) 
I learned A/B testing from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/tammyrotem/ab-tests-with-python/notebook and help Ze to figutr out which score performs better.
